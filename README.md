# Kinvey Postgres Flex Reference Connector

## This reference shows a low code mechanism to query against a Postgres database
###### It implements the GetAll route
Note that Kinvey handles the routing of the requst to the service and the APIs handle the sending of the response back to Kinvey for delivery to the web or mobile application.

Simply replace the *** fields with your Postgres connection details, deploy the service to Kinvey using our command line tools, associate the connector with your chosen collection, and that's all you need to do for data to flow!
